### [How to Create a Custom Control Using a Bitmask](https://cocoacasts.com/how-to-create-a-custom-control-using-a-bitmask/)

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

[Earlier this week](https://cocoacasts.com/how-to-work-with-bitmasks-in-swift/), I showed you how easy it is to work with bitmasks using Swift and the Swift standard library. In today's tutorial, I'd like to show you how to create a custom control that uses the `Schedule` structure we created [earlier](https://cocoacasts.com/how-to-work-with-bitmasks-in-swift/). This is what the result will look like when we're finished.

## Setting Up the Project In Xcode

Fire up Xcode, create a new project, and choose the **Single View Application** template from the **iOS > Application** section.

Name the project **Schedules** and set **Language** to **Swift**.
